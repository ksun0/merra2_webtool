# BICEP2 2014 Data Release
# The BICEP2 Collaboration, BICEP2 2014 II: EXPERIMENT AND THREE-YEAR DATA SET

# Date: 2014-12-16
#
# BICEP2 150 GHz band frequency spectrum as in BICEP2 II Fig. 11.
#   Column 1 = frequency in GHz
#   Column 2 = response to a source with uniform spectral radiance
#   Column 3 = response to a source with Rayleigh-Jeans spectrum
#
# Spectra are given for a beam filling source and have been peak-normalized.
# Negative values are at the noise level of the Fourier-transform spectroscopy
# measurement.
#
# This file replaces B2_frequency_spectrum_20140626.txt. It has been corrected
# to provide appropriate response of BICEP2 to an extended source. 
# Additionally, we now provide the bandpass in two formats. Response to a 
# source with uniform spectral radiance (column 2) matches the convention used
# in the Planck Reduced Instrument Model (http://pla.esac.esa.int/pla, see 
# Planck 2013 results IX). Response to a source with Rayleigh-Jeans spectrum 
# (column 3) matches the convention used in previous BICEP Collaboration 
# publications, as well as the WMAP bandpass files available on LAMBDA
# (http://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov).
